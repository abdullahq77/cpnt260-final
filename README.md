## Final 5 page Static Website

## Struggles/obstacles and notes
Had some trouble making the text easier to read. Choose a good contrast background or put a layer/bold behind your text. 
Choosing what to put in a div was also a little confusing. Assigned classes to some tags to make it easier
for me to customize. Getting the footer down was also tricky. Just used position to make it stay where I wanted it to be. Finding the 
right style to fit the website was quite difficult, but I searched up the proper fonts and pictures to go along with it. Media queries 
are also quite tough to workout for me.
